# ALTS-Registration

##Information
A simple website for the marking attendance at sessions 
for the Oxford University Alternative Ice Hockey Societey.
It uses php5 and sqlite3, and is inteded to be used with a
simple server like XAMPP.

Currently in alpha.

##Installation
We're probably going to use XAMPP, its fairly easy to use. I'll write instructions later.

If you have allready have server software: Ensure that sqlite is enabled (default for php5.4 and above I think), then copy the files to the web directory
